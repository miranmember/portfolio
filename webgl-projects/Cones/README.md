# Cone-Functions-Exercise
This project displays one or more cones, based on functions in the file coneFunctions.js. 
The project also includes a vertex shader and a fragment shader, which are embedded in the HTML file.

It is important to include the common directory in the direcotry before the project as it contains many of the important libraries that are needed for the project to work.

## How to Use
To use this project, simply open the coneFunctionsExercise.html file in a web browser that supports WebGL. The page will display one or more cones, with the number and appearance determined by the functions in coneFunctions.js.

## Additional Information
For more information on the vertex and fragment shaders, see the inline comments in the code. The coneFunctionsExercise.js file includes additional documentation on the functions and variables used in the project.
