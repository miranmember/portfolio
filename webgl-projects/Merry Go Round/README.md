# Merry-Go-Round
This is a program that creates a 3D merry-go-round using cones as the objects. The camera can be moved and rotated using the W, S, A, D keys and reset using the R key. The program can be quit using the Q key and help can be accessed using the H key.
The program uses event handlers to move the position of the camera and rotate the camera. Note that the camera has a fixed y axis. The color of the objects is randomly chosen to make it easier to notice the 3D objects. There is also a line in the middle of the merry-go-round, which was repurposed from a previous lab assignment.

This program is known to only work in Microsoft Edge. There is also an issue with Firefox where the merry-go-round does not display correctly.
## Note
It is important to keep the common directory before the merry go round directory because common directory contains important libraries.
