# Kaleidoscope-WebGL
This WebGL project creates a kaleidoscope effect by drawing an array of triangles around the center point of the canvas. The project includes an HTML file and a JavaScript file, triangle.js.
## How to Use
To use this project, simply open the HTML file in a web browser that supports WebGL. The page will display a kaleidoscope pattern made up of eight triangles, with the color and shape of the triangles determined by random numbers. If you want to see a new pattern, simply refresh the page. Each time the page is refreshed, the triangles will be randomly generated for a new kaleidoscope pattern.
## Additional Information
+ The triangle.js file includes additional documentation on the functions and variables used in the project. The HTML file also includes vertex and fragment shaders, which are used to render the triangles on the canvas.
+ It is important for the common directory to be before the triangle directory as the common directory contains important libraries.
